# Tidy Data

Tidying data is an excellent way to manipulate data in order to make the output much easier to read and analyze.

In the notebook, you will see the breakdown and understanding of where tidy data comes from along with an implementation using covid data.

Then, we test others by implementing similar questions but the only difference is that this notebooks contains the answers that we would have submitted.

Eventually, we will see the difference between data tidying and data wrangling.
